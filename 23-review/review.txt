Reviewing Kathryn and Lian's Code

Dating Simulator Game

=================================

Comments:
1. There were initially problems with your code in the "PROCESSING" pane
   but now I see that you guys moved to GUI, which might be easier to
   integrate with the other java files, just in my opinion.

basechar.java
- seems pretty straightforward

boys.java
- also seems pretty straightforward, just an extension of the basechar that
  will inherit basechar's traits

gym.java/prep.java
- implemented the reaction methods based on the approval and time parameters,
  seems okay

guilove.java
- maybe add some comments to show what each part of the code creates in the
  GUI, otherwise it's somewhat confusing to look at just the code
- from what I can tell the buttons change the setting of the game to the
  different files that extended boys.java (like gym, prep, etc)
- GUI is okay with buttons and stuff

map.pde
- I can't even begin because I don't know how to program in this

Code seems fine, although not quite put together yet.
